# Prediction-using-Unsupervised-ML
From the given 'Iris' dataset predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. This can be sloved using K-means clustering.
Basically,Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which models are trained using unlabeled dataset and are allowed to act on that data without any supervision.
